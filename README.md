## What is part of this?

### Development environment

#### Neovim

Current Neovim configuration is done in a way where it supports tree-sitter,
telescope, C, Lua, Markdown, Latex, Bash, formatting for those languages and LSP
for those languages.
The color-scheme is also trying to be compatible with 16 ANSI colors to not be
particularly environment dependent.
